# Interective ChatBot for Comilla University students

To match all the features in python environment we use many visual and function library. For visual representation we use tkinker and for conversation functionality we use chatterbot. Chatterbot takes input and returns appropriate answer according to the training data set. For user flexibility the training conversation set is separated from the main code. CoU Buddy can read any text file of certain format as a conversation dataset. Chatterbot also uses machine learning algorithm to optimize and get the correct output for the application.
